1. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- See past creations, when i modify so often some code, some time i want to know if i really had improved it. 
Or get some usefull code that i have developed before

2. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

- pros: you only make a commit for what is important.
		you can add a comment to that commit, that latter it will make the readme or change history part.
  cons: You could miss something.
